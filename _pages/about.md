## 👋 Introduction

I am **Hailong Jiang**, a Computer Science Ph.D. with expertise in HPC systems, compiler technologies, and the intersection of program analysis and large language models (LLMs). I have a proven track record in building innovative tools, publishing impactful research, and leading collaborative projects. **I am currently a Tenure Track Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Youngstown State University (YSU).**

I am honored to have presented my PhD research at **SC'24** - The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis in Atlanta, GA. My doctoral showcase highlighted three pivotal works that advance HPC resilience analysis using LLMs:

- **HAPPA Platform**: Achieved MSE of 0.078 in SDC prediction, outperforming existing models by 30%
- **Loop Resilience Analysis**: Quantified SDC rates for the 13 dwarfs of parallelism using semantic analysis
- **IR Code Analysis**: Evaluated LLM capabilities in low-level code understanding and program analysis

## 🔬 Latest Research

**🎉 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: ICML 2025 ACCEPTED!**

My latest research investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models in understanding Intermediate Representations (IRs) for compiler design and program analysis. This pioneering empirical study evaluates GPT-4, GPT-3, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.1, and Code Llama across four critical tasks:

- **Control Flow Graph (CFG) reconstruction**
- **IR decompilation**
- **Code summarization**
- **Execution reasoning**

**This work has been accepted to ICML 2025** - one of the most prestigious conferences in machine learning, representing a significant breakthrough in my research career at the intersection of AI and compiler technologies.
