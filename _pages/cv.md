## Summary

**Tenure Track Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Youngstown State University.** My research focuses on HPC systems, compiler technologies, and the intersection of program analysis and large language models (LLMs) to build intelligent infrastructure for scientific computing. Meanwhile, I'm increasingly interested in applying LLMs to medical data analysis, especially in building interpretable and reliable AI for healthcare. I'm actively exploring opportunities to contribute to interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI and medicine.
